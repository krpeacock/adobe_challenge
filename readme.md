## Adobe Frontend Coding Challenge

### Directions:
To get started, clone this repository from https://github.com/krpeacock/adobe_challenge.git and navigate into the directory.

Run `npm install` in Terminal to download the required assets from Node Package Manager. (I'm assuming you are on MacOs. Sorry if I'm prejudiced.)

Once the download has finished, run `npm start` to run the application. 

You will be able to view the website in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

```
